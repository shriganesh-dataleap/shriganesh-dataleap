<a id="supervised-learning"></a>
## 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning encompasses a category of machine learning algorithms that learn from labeled training data. Labeled data contains input-output pairs, where each input is associated with a correct output. The algorithm utilizes this training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. Some popular supervised learning algorithms include:

<a id="linear-regression"></a>
### 1.1. Linear Regression

_Linear regression is a simple algorithm that models the linear relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables._

To gain a deeper understanding of linear regression, you can refer to this comprehensive resource: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

#### Python Implementation

We'll use the `sklearn` library to implement linear regression in Python:

```python
# Import required libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the data
data=pd.read_csv("housing.csv")
X=data.iloc[:,:-1].values
y=data.iloc[:,-1].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training and Testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)

# Create and train the model
linear_regression = LinearRegression()
linear_regression.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = linear_regression.predict(X_test)
```

_For a more comprehensive tutorial on linear regression, check out [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-machine-learning-algorithms-linear-regression-14c4e325882a)_.

<a id="logistic-regression"></a>
### 1.2. Logistic Regression

_Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that models the probability of a certain class or event._

A great resource for understanding logistic regression is the same [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) book from above.

#### Python Implementation

We'll implement logistic regression using the `sklearn` library:

```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load the dataset
data=pd.read_csv("iris.csv")
X=data.iloc[:,:-1].values
y=data.iloc[:,-1].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training and Testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)

# Create and train the model
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression()
logistic_regression.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = logistic_regression.predict(X_test)
```

_For an in-depth tutorial on logistic regression implementation using Python, have a look at [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-logistic-regression-66248243c148)_.

<a id="k-nearest-neighbors"></a>
### 1.3. K-Nearest Neighbors

_The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems._

A detailed explanation of KNN can be found in this [blog post](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/03/introduction-k-neighbours-algorithm-clustering/).

#### Python Implementation

Using the `sklearn` library again, we'll implement KNN for classification:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Load dataset
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Splitting the dataset into the Training and Testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)

# Create and train the model
k_nearest_neighbor = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 3)
k_nearest_neighbor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = k_nearest_neighbor.predict(X_test)
```

_For a comprehensive KNN tutorial, head over to [this tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/k-nearest_neighbors_in_python/)_.

### 1.4. Decision Trees and Random Forests

_Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks._

Another great reference on decision trees and random forests is the previously mentioned [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) textbook.

#### Python Implementation

Using `sklearn`, we'll implement a decision tree classifier:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Load dataset
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Splitting the dataset into the Training and Testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)

# Create and train the model
tree_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()
tree_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = tree_classifier.predict(X_test)
```

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Load dataset
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)

# Splitting the dataset into the Training and Testing set
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)

# Create and train the model
svm_classifier = SVC(kernel = 'linear', random_state = 42)
svm_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = svm_classifier.predict(X_test)
```
